<h2 class="mb-4">About The Book</h2>
<p>The book "EverySingle" is a guide to incorporating prayers and confessions into your daily life, particularly focusing on relationships and marriage. It offers practical advice, personal testimonies, and effective prayers to help you navigate the journey to finding your life partner and experiencing the power of prayer in your marital destiny.</p>
<div class="text-about">
<h4>Testimonial</h4>
<p>I got 3 marriage proposals in less than six months. The proposals came between May 8, 2010, and June 12, 2010; 2 in May and 1 in June (cha cha!) They dropped like credit alerts! Lol!</p>
<p>I was literally awed by God’s might and extraordinary strategy that was deployed for me after practicing less than 6 months of intense confessions and other spiritual exercises.</p>
